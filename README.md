# Simple Teller .js

Simple, json-fed story teller engine.

Inspired by the elegance and simplicity of [deltatre' SportTeller](http://www.deltatre.com/online-solutions/sportteller/)
(with examples
[here](http://www.europeantour.com/sportteller/us-open-day-4-in-numbers.html),
[here](http://www.gaa.ie/sportteller-content/stories/1/1/55b33bda-d289-41a6-ba6e-a3e094201f36/index.html#Slide_2),
and

), I deciced to make a simpler, free, alternative.

SimpleTeller creates a single web page which contains stories.

A story is a list of facts.

A fact is a background image, animation, or video, with content laid over it.
Content is a collection of information displayed as text, table, or graphics.


Simple Teller uses other plugins, like the Anything plugin, to display and animate your content.
(Anything plugin is so simple that you can really stick anything in a slide' section!)

I use c3 (based on d3) for graphs because it is simpler than d3, based on d3, and I use d3 for DOM manipulation and JSON loading.
Of course, d3 opens doors for more customisation if you wish.


Simple Teller just started, so expect documentation, tests, and complex examples in the following weeks.
