# Simple Teller .js

Simple, json-based story teller engine.

Inspired by the elegance and simplicity of [deltatre' SportTeller](http://www.deltatre.com/online-solutions/sportteller/)
(with examples
[here](http://www.europeantour.com/sportteller/us-open-day-4-in-numbers.html),
[here](http://www.gaa.ie/sportteller-content/stories/1/1/55b33bda-d289-41a6-ba6e-a3e094201f36/index.html#Slide_2),
and
[here](http://www.europeantour.com/sportteller/bmw-pga-championship-day-1-in-numbers.html)
), I deciced to make a simpler, free, alternative.

SimpleTeller creates a single web page which contains stories.

A story is a list of facts.

A fact is a background image, with content overlaid on it.
Content is a collection of sniplets that display text or graphics.


Simple Teller is a Reveal.js plugin.
It needs other plugins like the Anything or d3 plugins to function properly.

Simple Teller just started, so expect documentation, tests, and complex examples in the following weeks.
